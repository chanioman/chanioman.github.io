  Drivers' parking location choice under uncertain parking availability
  and search times: A stated preference experiment.
  <i>Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice</i>, 82:228 -

<span class="span2" tabindex="0">[Show Abstract]</span><span class="span3" tabindex="0">[Hide]</span><p class="alert" >To assess parking pricing policies and parking information and reservation systems, it is essential to understand how drivers choose their parking location. A key aspect is how drivers' behave towards uncertainties towards associated search times and finding a vacant parking spot. This study presents the results from a stated preference experiment on the choice behaviour of drivers, in light of these uncertainties. The attribute set was selected based on a literature review, and appended with the probabilities of finding a vacant parking spot upon arrival and after 8 min (and initially also after 4 min, but later dropped to reduce the survey complexity). Efficient Designs were used to create the survey design, where two rounds of pilot studies were conducted to estimate prior coefficients. Data was successfully collected from 397 respondents. Various random utility maximisation (RUM) choice models were estimated, including multinomial logit, nested logit, and mixed logit, as well as models accounting for panel effects. These model analyses show how drivers appear to accept spending time on searching for a vacant parking spot, where parking availability after 8 min ranks second most important factor in determining drivers' parking decisions, whilst parking availability upon arrival ranks fourth. Furthermore, the inclusion of heterogeneity in preferences and inter-driver differences is found to increase the predictive power of the parking location choice model. The study concludes with an outlook of how these insights into drivers' parking behaviour can be incorporated into traffic assignment models and used to support parking systems. </p>

  Network criticality and network complexity indicators for the

<span class="span2" tabindex="0">[Show Abstract]</span><span class="span3" tabindex="0">[Hide]</span><p class="alert" >Network criticality indicators, such as the Uniﬁed Network Performance Meas-ure, provide powerful tools for interested entities who aim to assess those parts of the network, the closure of which would mostly affect its overall perfor-mance. The progress in complex networks analysis on the premises of graph theory allowed for advances on the identiﬁcation of network characteristics and alternative sets of indicators for the evaluation of network performance. The aim of the present paper is to lay out the contribution of network analytics (in the form of complexity and criticality indicators) in disaster management, with the road network of the Peloponnese region, Greece acting as a case study. Findings show that adopting interdisciplinary advances can provide use-ful insights to entities, responsible for the mitigation, preparedness, response, and reconstruction phases of disaster management and support them in the complex decision making process.</p>

  Use of geotagged social media in urban settings: Empirical evidence

<span class="span2" tabindex="0">[Show Abstract]</span><span class="span3" tabindex="0">[Hide]</span><p class="alert" >Social media can be valuable in transportation research, as data collected contain information for mobility patterns and behavioural characteristics that could not be previously obtained. This paper introduces a methodology for the collection and analysis of data from Social Media, for transportation-related uses, first in a generic methodological framework and then particularly for Twitter. The data collection methodology is applied using Twitter and some initial descriptive statistics are presented concerning the characteristics of users and their posts. Results from spatial analysis is presented, conducted using data from the geotagged service of Twitter. The results of the analysis present trends on the use of Twitter for leisure activities and a correlation between high income areas and number of tweets posted. Finally, the potential of using data from Social Media is discussed with the issues that arise.</p>

<span class="span2" tabindex="0">[Show Abstract]</span><span class="span3" tabindex="0">[Hide]</span><p class="alert" >Leisure activities travel demand plays an important role in transportation, as it accounts for a significant amount of trips performed. Due to data limitations the examination of this trip purpose has received moderate attention so far. The evolution of pervasive systems in conjunction to the increased use of Social Media provide a large amount of data that can be used for the development of leisure activities travel demand models. This study provides an initial investigation of the data collected from Social Media and the potential of using it for leisure activities demand modelling. A data analysis framework is provided that distinguish user classes of residents and tourists and investigates the temporal and spatial patterns as well as the probability of deriving activity locations.</p>

Concerning complex network analysis, the networks used were examined on their structure and their properties. The analysis focus on small world networks and the scale-free property. It was found that small world properties can be an appropriate modelling structure for transportation networks also in Greece while the scale-free property is not widely met. The analysis was performed on the highway network of Europe, the Thessaloniki urban network and the Thessaloniki Public Transport network. For the two latter, graph measures were applied and analysed.</p>

  Validation of everscape, the evacuation simulator.

<span class="span2" tabindex="0">[Show Abstract]</span><span class="span3" tabindex="0">[Hide]</span><p class="alert" >This paper presents the validation of the evacuation 3D simulator known as Everscape against the conventional Stated Preference data collection methods. Everscape was developed under the cooperation of TU Delft and the Tokyo institute for the inference of the behaviour in case of a disaster. It seems that people behave much alike the human interactions observed in such situations and that unobserved features where able to be captured. However, as it is a rather new method its validity is still in question. This paper presents the comparison of the two data collection methods (Simulator and Stated Preference). The comparison is based on two statistically identical samples for which the decisions taken are investigated. The research concludes that at least for the statistically identical samples examined the results are statistically the same. Conclusions are drawn for the beneﬁts of using such a tool against the conventional Stated Preference data collection methods.</p>
